        Generally, these are eligible we want to speak to about the upcoming election.
        
        We rely on the great help of volunteers like you, to talk to as many voters as possible.
        
        In order to do so, you need what we call a "Turf List", but we'll just call it a voter list here.
        
        Basically, this is a smaller list, taken from our overall voter targets, so we can pass it out to you, so you know who to talk to and where.""")
